# Python implementation of Robula+
Robula+ is an algorithm to generate robust XPath-based locators, that are likely to work correctly with new releases of a web application. Robula+ reduces the locators' fragility on average by 90% w.r.t. absolute locators and by 63% w.r.t. Selenium IDE locators [[1]](#about).
